= TODOS =

- make a JS test prep script so that we can install the fixtures
  from the Test::Jackalope::Fixtures::Manager modules

== LOW PRIORITY ==

- Jackalope.js
    - add some kind of basic Bread-Board type thing

- Jackalope.Schema.Spec
    - perhaps use that description cleanup method in GenerateSpec on the actual spec

- Test.Jackalope
    - validation_fail should also take some kind of
      test to check the right error appears
        - fixtures will need to support this too

- test_fixtures
    - write more of them
